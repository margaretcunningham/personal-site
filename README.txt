Hi, I'm Margaret Cunningham ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal portfolio! Iâ€™m a software engineer who supports and maintains tools used by verification engineers. I primarily work with Ruby and Perl, focusing on creating reliable, efficient tools that make engineering workflows smoother.
ðŸ”§ What I Do

Tool Development & Support: Ensuring the tools engineers rely on are stable, efficient, and easy to maintain.
Code Quality Assurance: Writing unit and integration tests, automating builds with Jenkins, and enforcing clean, maintainable code with RuboCop.
Version Control: Managing code with Git to keep everything organized and trackable.

ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Into

Iâ€™m always learningâ€”whether itâ€™s new programming languages, better ways to solve problems, or diving into projects that challenge my skills.
