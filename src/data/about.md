Hi, I'm Margaret Cunningham ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal portfolio! Iâ€™m a software engineer with a passion for building reliable, efficient tools and creating clean, maintainable code. I primarily work with Ruby and Perl, but Iâ€™m always excited to explore new technologies.

ðŸ”§ What I Do

Tool Development: Designing and maintaining tools that improve engineering workflows.

Code Quality Assurance: Writing unit and integration tests, automating builds with Jenkins, and ensuring clean, efficient code with RuboCop.

Version Control: Managing code with Git to keep projects organized and trackable.

Documentation: Creating clear, concise technical documentation to support code maintainability, facilitate team collaboration, and streamline onboarding processes.  

ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Into
Iâ€™m always learningâ€”whether itâ€™s new programming languages, UI/UX design principles, or tackling projects that push my problem-solving skills.
